description = "THIS MOD MUST BE RUN BY THE HOST TO WORK. OFF-HOST IT DOES NOTHING.\n\nThis mod makes it so that Devastating Blow's secondary effect - increased stagger from melee hits - works properly for clients connected to your game. Normally, this secondary effect only works for the host.\n\nI would have liked to make a mod that clients can run to fix the trait in their own game, but there are significant logistical issues to such a solution that I'm not sure I can overcome. This is because the function that handles on-hit stagger (DamageUtils.calculate_stagger) runs host-side.\n\nNote: One side-effect of running this mod is that the on-attack stagger from Devastating Blow will work even if the trait is not unlocked for the weapon held. This is due to a limitation I ran into (which happens to be related to the issue that causes the devblow bug in the first place) that I've yet to find a way around.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/Zeropathic/Vermintide-1-mods/tree/master/DevBlowFix";

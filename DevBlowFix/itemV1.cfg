description = "This mod makes it so that Devastating Blow's secondary effect - increased stagger from melee hits - works properly for clients connected to your game. Normally, this secondary effect only works for the host.

I would have liked to make a mod that clients can run to fix the trait in their own game, but there are significant logistical issues to such a solution that I'm not sure I can overcome. This is because the function that handles on-hit stagger (DamageUtils.calculate_stagger) runs host-side.

Note: One side-effect of running this mod is that the on-attack stagger from Devastating Blow will work even if the trait is not unlocked for the weapon held. This is due to a limitation I ran into (which happens to be related to the issue that causes the devblow bug in the first place) that I've yet to find a way around.

description = "THIS MOD MUST BE RUN BY THE HOST TO WORK. OFF-HOST IT DOES NOTHING.\n\nThis mod makes it so that Devastating Blow's secondary effect - increased stagger from melee hits - works properly for clients connected to your game.  In practice, this means that some weapons (Glaive or 1h axe, for example) can stagger stormvermin out of their overhead swings with normal attacks. Normally, this secondary effect only works for the host.\n\nI would have liked to make a mod that clients can run to fix the trait in their own game, but there are significant logistical issues to such a solution that I'm not sure I can overcome. This is because the function that handles on-hit stagger (DamageUtils.calculate_stagger) runs host-side.\n\nNOTE: One side-effect of running this mod is that the on-attack stagger from Devastating Blow will work even if the trait is not unlocked for the weapon held. This is due to a limitation I ran into (which happens to be related to the issue that causes the devblow bug in the first place) that I've yet to find a way around.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/Zeropathic/Vermintide-1-mods/tree/master/DevBlowFix";
